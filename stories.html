                                The request to update the database daily made me how to create a pipeline.<br/>
                                In this request I have to create a SQL dump from a active repository which changed daily<br/>
                                This repository contains a lots of information which are essential for the INFOSEC but they can not access them directly
                                therefore we need to upload them to a GUI which they as users can access daily using their own credential.<br/>
                                For this pipeline, I will use the Gitlab CICD, which hold that repository, adjust the gitlab_ci to create an task:<br/>
                                - Using docker to import the repository using gitlab runner, using import script to import all yaml files in this repo 
                                and convert them to proper table.<br/>
                                - after the database is created, extract that database as the dump file and saved them as artifacts.<br/>
                                - create another task to upload that to S3.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                When the file is upload to S3, there are two options to restore them to Aurora/RDS<br/>
                                - Using AWS EC2 and using AWS CLI there to do the restore, because the RDS and other components are in the private VPC, therefore
                                we cannot just use AWS CLI locally, which make unnecessary provisioning a EC2 just for that.<br/>
                                - Using AwS Lambda with a self-created layer (Using Dockerfile) for import using python <br/>
                                With the new Lambda, it can get an trigger from S3 whenever S3 get the new artifacts, it will run this Python script to restore the 
                                new data to RDS<br/>
                                
                                Then last thing to do is schedule the pipeline x2 daily on Gitlab CICD<br/>
                                Now you have a complete Gitlab Pipeline including #s3#gitlab_ci#aws_lambda#aws_aurora_rds#python#Docker<br/>

                                many things happened and of course, the journey was not easy as it would seems. I have thought a lots

                                OIDC with mod_auth_openidc, Azure and Exchange EntraID with the AppReg for Oauth2. All of these steps are required
                                in my migration to ensure the OTRS/Znuny can be used with the best intergration.<br/>

                                During these 6 months of headache with AWS in my small project to migrate a on prems server to the cloud,
                                I realize that AWS has all the things you need as a sysadmin/developer.<br/>
                                However the time which I have to spend to navigate between the sites of all the services/functions of AWS make
                                me understand the importance of IaC such as (Terraform). <br/>
                                Together with Ansible, I can provise a simple infrastructure with an EC2 as main base (with the automatic mounting 
                                of difference NVMe which required a bash script which I am very proud of) and the migration to the cloud was successfully completed.
                                <br/>
                                The next step should be about the authentication with AWS Cloud EC2 and Oauth2/OIDC. Anyone can help me with this?<br/>

                            Hetzner and GitHub Actions are both popular tools in the DevOps ecosystem, and they complement each other well in various aspects of the development and deployment pipeline.
                            That's why I choose them to begin my Devops Journey. It is clear to me that a lots will choose AWS (because of their popularity)
                            and Gitlab( it is free, why not?). First AWS free tier is not really free if you have no idea what you are doing with it, so it is not really
                            something I suggest for a beginner, and you are really have to take care of the billing. Hetzner based in Germany, and it is not
                            too bad to support the local cloud :D.<br/>
                            Gitlab is really popular in corporation but in order to take care of self hosted runner
                            then I thinks it is not really good for beginner. In case you have some self hosted Gitlab cloud server somewhere to runner
                            24/7 then it is fine.<br/>
                            Anyway, the first CI/CD of mine are used with these combo. Using Terraform to provision a server on Hetzner that runs
                            Analytical Tools, which used Flask, for my wife. I am pretty happy with it as it is a first step of mine on this devops/cloud journey.

                                It would be nice if everyone can understand what is the difference between
                                these jobs.<br/>
                                Helpdesk typically deal with problems that involve the desktop/laptop and pheripherals
                                (mouse, headphone, and maybe even PRINTER (the devil if you know)), basically the work involves
                                more with the users.<br/>
                                Sysadmin keeps the whole IT infrastructure going, scripting, maintaining, updating the 
                                system so that it won't get down whenever happens (hacking,attacking). Logging and 
                                Data collecting are also part of your jobs incase your Product Owner/Technical IT Manager
                                demands it.<br/>
                                So now you understand what is the difference between two of them, then what will you choose?

                            I was wondering that myself too. In 2018-2019, during the time, 
                            I was working as an intern at Future Electronics in Munich. 
                            I had lots of opportunities to understand what can I do 
                            after finishing my degree in ET/IT.<br/>
                            I had lots of chance to tinkering with PCG from multiple famous manufacturers like NXP
                            , ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, etc. and it involves lots of embedding 
                            and C Programming. 
                            It was more fun for me to combine the PCB Boards with lots of sensors, 
                            and to see that it can do many types of application 
                            (like how the hell can the light turn on or the temps of your hand 
                            when you hover your hand?)<br/>
                            So yeah, it would be nice if EE can code, 
                            and of course it is possible that you can do that full time too.<br/>
