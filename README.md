# Ai Viet Hoang


Sysadmin in Germany


I built this portfolio on GitHub Pages as a simple, fast, and reliable way to showcase my projects and skillset. By hosting directly from my repositories, I can keep everything version-controlled, always up to date, and publicly accessibleâ€”turning GitHub itself into both a code hub and a personal portfolio.

this next.js repo used some snippets from https://reactbits.dev/. Shoutout to the dev there.
